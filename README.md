# Data Visualization

[Visualizing Sequencing Run/Lane Metrics from BaseSpace with Interactive Tableau Dashboards](https://github.com/ericsmith2500/tableau-basespace)

These Tableau dashboards display interactive trends in sequencing run quality. They also include instrument utilization and lane-quality pass-rate configuration, and sequencing yield visualization. 

# Python Applications

[Python Software Development Kit (SDK) for BaseSpace Sequence Hub](https://github.com/basespace/basespace-python-sdk)

The BaseSpace python SDK enables using BaseSpace directy from python, without needing to call the BaseSpace API directly. 

[PicardSpace - A Web Application for BaseSpace](https://github.com/basespace/PicardSpace)

PicardSpace is an example web application for BaseSpace. It demonstrated how full-stack python applications could be written to analyze sequencing data and optionally bill users.
